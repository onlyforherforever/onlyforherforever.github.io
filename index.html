        headline: "The story of facing changes and how it affected my life with a crush.",
        story: "My story began when I was in the 9th grade, I had changed schools, and it was my first day at my new school, I expected to make new friends and experience a new environment, one that would be better than my previous school, but what happened was entirely different, the experience was devastating, when I entered the classroom, there were only a few people, all busy writing something in their notebooks, I walked in, but no one even looked up to ask who I was, I ended up sitting on the last bench, feeling like everything was very strange, the day began with classes, English went fine, and so did the language classes, I thought I had made a good decision, but then came math class, the teacher told me that I had joined late, and they had almost finished the first chapter, she informed me that I needed to catch up by completing nearly 70 pages of notes, not only that—I also had to catch up on notes for chemistry, physics, and biology, I didn't feel the weight of it all at that moment, I stayed back at school until 5:30 to finish the notes, luckily, I had my friend Naveen, who stayed with me to keep me company while I did my homework, I thought I had made a good friend and that things would improve, but I was mistaken, I deeply missed my old friends, and the teachers at this new school were intensely focused on academics, that night, I stayed up until 1:30 a.m. to complete all my notes and finally finished them, but just as I thought I was done, I realized I had four tests the next day, it was hard to study, given how much I'd already had to do, to make things worse, I had mistakenly written my biology notes in a ruled notebook when they were supposed to go in an unruled one, the teacher tore out the pages and told me to rewrite everything, my social studies teacher asked me to read and memorize the preamble because I couldn’t answer her questions, I started feeling very down and wished I could go back to my old school, I began to regret my decision to switch schools, I tried hard to adjust, but it was overwhelming, the teachers assigned practice notebooks, which were filled with lecture notes that I had to write by reading the textbook and understanding the content, I wrote all the practice notes and submitted them on time, but there was even more work waiting for me, I had daily tests in each subject, and I had to study for those too, often sacrificing sleep, the one bright spot was that they made me the Yellow House captain in my school, I was recognized by my juniors, and I won the election for the role with their support, my friends were there to help me overcome my challenges, supporting me through it all, as Yellow House captain, I worked hard to help my team succeed in sports and managed to keep up with my academics too, it was a proud moment to speak on stage at the school ceremony, I even got the chance to participate in cultural events, which brought me some recognition and fame, around that time, I had my first crush—a beautiful girl in my class, I felt a deep connection with her from the start, I told my friends, and they offered to help me express my feelings, I became friends with her but didn’t have the courage to tell her how I really felt, I kept it a secret, hoping for the right moment, I remember doing some awkward things back then; if I could go back in time, I would give myself a stern reminder to act differently, I was a good friend to her, and I think that’s all I was capable of being at that time, I finally expressed my feelings on the day of the cultural event, but it didn’t go as I’d hoped, when I told her that I liked her, she revealed that she liked one of my friends and that they had recently broken up, she said she might have liked me if we had met earlier, but now we could only be friends, her words were painful, and it took me about three months to move on, but I continued being a loyal friend to her, which is something I feel proud of to this day, over time, the school became like a second home to me, I spent nearly 10 hours there each day, more than I did at home, I fulfilled my council duties, completed 10th grade with a good score, and in 11th grade, I was appointed assistant head boy, a role I earned with the popularity I had built in the school, looking back, even though these changes made me feel bad at times, they played a major role in shaping my character, I believe my school experience helped shape who I am today, especially in developing my leadership skills, I hope my story shows that everyone faces challenges in life, but after overcoming them, the journey becomes sweet, thank you for reading patiently!",

        headline: "Back to School - Chapter 01",
        story: "Long ago, there lived a boy named Zzz. He was a very small kid and didn't know anything about the environment or people. He went to school daily but was a below-average student. He didn't even do his homework. The funny guy was not at all interested in studies, and so he scored poor marks. His parents were very loving and kept motivating him with kind words even though he scored poorly. He didn't even have his own unique handwriting. He always tried to copy homework from other students—not only the content but also the handwriting itself. He had different handwriting for different subjects! That's why he couldn't maintain good handwriting. Months passed, years passed. Now he was in 3rd standard. One day, as usual, he forgot to do his math homework and submitted his notebook blank. His math teacher, named Rekha, called his name. With fear in his eyes, Zzz walked slowly towards his teacher.  His math teacher angrily asked him why he didn't do his homework. He replied to his teacher with a shaky, trembling voice that he 'forgot.' Hearing that, his math teacher became furious and took a wooden pencil, placing it between Zzz's fingers. She held his fingers tightly with one hand and kept twisting the pencil with the other. Zzz started crying out loud in pain. Yet, the math teacher didn't stop and kept twisting the pencil. Zzz's body shivered heavily that whole day, and he couldn't even hold anything with his hand. He couldn't tolerate that much physical pain and cried all day. His poor little eyes dried up from crying. He somehow managed to eat lunch, but only a quarter of what was in his lunch box. That incident left a lifelong trauma in his heart, and he hated math very much. Somehow, he passed all the exams and was promoted to class 4. Do you think this silly guy would change in the 4th standard? Nah, that's not in his case. One day, he forgot his social science homework and submitted it blank. As usual, a strict social science teacher entered the class... to be continued...",
