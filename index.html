        story: "Long ago, there lived a boy named Zzz. He was a very small kid and didn't know anything about the environment or people. He went to school daily but was a below-average student. He didn't even do his homework. The funny guy was not at all interested in studies, and so he scored poor marks. His parents were very loving and kept motivating him with kind words even though he scored poorly. He didn't even have his own unique handwriting. He always tried to copy homework from other students—not only the content but also the handwriting itself. He had different handwriting for different subjects! That's why he couldn't maintain good handwriting. Months passed, years passed. Now he was in 3rd standard. One day, as usual, he forgot to do his math homework and submitted his notebook blank. His math teacher, named Rekha, called his name. With fear in his eyes, Zzz walked slowly towards his teacher.  His math teacher angrily asked him why he didn't do his homework. He replied to his teacher with a shaky, trembling voice that he 'forgot.' Hearing that, his math teacher became furious and took a wooden pencil, placing it between Zzz's fingers. She held his fingers tightly with one hand and kept twisting the pencil with the other. Zzz started crying out loud in pain. Yet, the math teacher didn't stop and kept twisting the pencil. Zzz's body shivered heavily that whole day, and he couldn't even hold anything with his hand. He couldn't tolerate that much physical pain and cried all day. His poor little eyes dried up from crying. He somehow managed to eat lunch, but only a quarter of what was in his lunch box. That incident left a lifelong trauma in his heart, and he hated math very much. Somehow, he passed all the exams and was promoted to class 4. Do you think this silly guy would change in the 4th standard? Nah, that's not in his case. One day, he forgot his social science homework and submitted it blank. As usual, a strict social science teacher entered the class... to be continued...",
