**Telegram Bot! https://t.me/onlyforhersforever_bot**

# Method 2: 
1.  **Go to the GitHub repository:** Visit the project's GitHub repository at [https://github.com/onlyforherforever/onlyforherforever](https://github.com/onlyforherforever/onlyforherforever).

2.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

3.  **Edit the HTML file:** In your forked repository, navigate to the `index.html` file and locate the `posts` array within the `<script>` tag.

4.  **Add your story:** Add your story to the **top** of the `posts` array using the following format:

    ```javascript
    {
      avatar: "YOUR_AVATAR_URL",
      username: "YOUR_USERNAME",
      date: "DATE_OF_STORY",
      storyType: "STORY_TYPE",
      headline: "YOUR_HEADLINE",

    }, 
    ```

    *   Replace the placeholders with your actual information.
    *   Make sure to add your story object as a **new entry at the beginning of the array**, not at the end. This will ensure your story appears at the top of the page.

5.  **Commit your changes:** Save the changes you made to the `index.html` file and commit them to your forked repository.
